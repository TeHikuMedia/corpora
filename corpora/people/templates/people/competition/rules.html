<br>
<h3>Who may enter</h3>

  <p>Anyone may enter the competition unless you fall under the &quot;Who may not enter&quot; details below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>You must join a group in order to compete in the group competition.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Who may not enter</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p>All persons or groups affiliated with Te Reo Irirangi o Te Hiku o Te Ika are not eligible for prizes. This includes current staff, volunteers, and contractors as well as previous staff and contractors who were a part of the Kōrero Māori project.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How to enter</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Members must create an account at <a href="http://koreromaori.com/signup">koreromaori.com/signup</a> and verify their email address in order to compete.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>To join a group, type the name of your group into the Groups box on the profile page, <a href="http://koreromaori.com/tangata/profile">koreromaori.com/tangata/profile</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>If your group has not been created yet, the Groups box will show a &#39;Create&#39; option - click that to create your group. You must be logged in to create a new group.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Make sure your group members use the exact group name when joining.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Each group must have at least 7 members that have done at least 1 recording each to be eligible for cash prizes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Each individual may only set up one account and join one group during the competition period.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>You may enter at any time - e.g. a person may join mid way through the competition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Anyone with an existing profile on Kōrero Māori may join a group by editing their profile - however, their existing recordings and points will not transfer to that group.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How to earn points</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p>You earn points for each correct recording you do during the competition period (from 1pm on the 15th of March to 6pm on the 25th of March - New Zealand time).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>A correct recording equals good pronunciation and reading exactly what is in the sentence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>When you have completed the recording and saved it, you will receive a partial point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>When your recording has been reviewed and approved by the judging panel, you will receive the rest of the point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>If your recording is of a poor quality then you will not receive a point for that recording.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Your group&rsquo;s score is the sum of all your group member&#39;s scores. The more members in your group, the easier it is to earn points. There is no limit to the number of people you may have in your group.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>If your group or a member of your group is found to be consistently submitting incorrect recordings, your group will be contacted and if it is found to be intentional, the group member&rsquo;s account may be temporarily deactivated.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
